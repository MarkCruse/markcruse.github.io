Last night, I had the pleasure of visiting Blue Stallion Brewery. It was a delightful experience as I indulged in a flight of their exceptional flagship German beers. The flavors were truly outstanding, and I couldn't resist trying their delectable Pretzel & Pimento shareable, which complemented the beers perfectly.

This project aims to uncover fresh perspectives on the communities where we reside and work. In some U.S. cities, there has been a remarkable shift over the past three decades, as they have evolved into both residential and work destinations. This contrasts with predictions made years ago that the rise of the Internet would eliminate commuting, with the expectation that "remote work for everyone" would become the norm. However, this prediction has not materialized, and certain regions of the country continue to face lengthy commute times exceeding an hour.

The objective of this endeavor is to develop a methodology for extracting data from census records and generating maps that shed light on the commuting patterns between people's homes and workplaces. The significance of commuting trends and workplace employment statistics extends to a diverse range of individuals, including urban and regional planners, researchers in fields like social science and transportation, as well as various businesses.

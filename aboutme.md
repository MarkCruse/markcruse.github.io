### My story

My primary interests revolve around cartography, photography, computer programming, data analysis, travel, and amateur radio. I consider myself a tinkerer, often delving into areas that may seem beyond my expertise. I thrive on curiosity and am always eager to explore new and challenging endeavors. I find great satisfaction in pushing my boundaries and welcome the opportunity to tackle complex problems, as I genuinely enjoy a good challenge. It's in the face of difficulty that I discover the most about myself and my capabilities.

### Education and work
I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems from Western Kentucky University, which paved the way for a fulfilling 20+ year career in the field of information technology. Throughout my career, I have gained experience in various roles, including desktop and server support, computer programming, and management of technical teams.

In 2014, I embarked on my second career as a data professional, a journey that continues to captivate me today. My focus on data analytics has led to the advancement of my proficiency in Python, SQL, and visualization tools. I am dedicated to crafting data-driven solutions that enhance user experiences and contribute to business growth.

In addition to technical skills, my unique blend of non-technical abilities, fueled by empathy and curiosity, enables me to excel in understanding stakeholders' needs, creating insightful reports, and crafting visualizations with compelling narratives. Strong communication and interpersonal skills allow me to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical audiences, distilling complex information clearly. I approach my work with a positive attitude, collaborative spirit, and proactive, autonomous project management style.

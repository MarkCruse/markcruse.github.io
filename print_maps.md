The maps presented below were generated using Python to create GeoPackage files. These files were subsequently imported into QGIS to create print-ready maps. 

For those interested in exploring the basics of working with Python and OSMNx, I have created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MarkCruse/coloring-street-networks-using-OSMnx). This repository serves as a valuable resource, providing a beginning for leveraging Python and OSMNx in geospatial data analysis and map creation.
